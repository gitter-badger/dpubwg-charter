# Charter development for a Digital Publishing Working Group

This [very early draft](http://w3c.github.io/dpubwg-charter/) is expected to be an input to the chartering process of a DPUB Working Group, envisioned as part of the combination of IDPF and W3C whose plans have been [announced in May 2016](https://www.w3.org/2016/05/digpub.html.en) and which should come to fruition in early 2017. The development of this charter will be driven by the Publishing Business Group, to be set up as the first step of the combination of the two organizations. The early draft charter draws on the work of the [Digital Publishing Interest Group](https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG), and that group will continue to contribute to the technical aspects of the charter (particularly to sections [1: “Scope”](http://w3c.github.io/dpubwg-charter/#scope) and [2: “Deliverables”](http://w3c.github.io/dpubwg-charter/#deliverables)).

Issues and comments from the public at large, but especially from the representatives of IDPF and W3C members, are encouraged and highly welcome. Comments should be submitted by raising [issues](https://github.com/w3c/dpubwg-charter/issues) on this (public) repository. (In the case of a problems, comments can also be sent to the editor of this document, Ivan Herman, [ivan@w3.org](mailto:ivan@w3.org), who will submit the comment to the issue list in the commenter’s name.)

(See the [HTML view](http://w3c.github.io/dpubwg-charter/) of the draft.)
